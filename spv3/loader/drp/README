This tree contains the DRP (Discord Rich Presence) source code, which
aims to ingrate SPV3.2 with Discord by allowing players to display the

The source code has been generously developed and provided by giraffe,
and has been integrated into a custom Visual C++ project for convenient
reproducible builds.
